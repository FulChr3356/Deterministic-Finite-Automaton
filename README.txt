Operations done: Text search and Simulating DFA


To run simDFA.py simple enter into  the terminal $ python3 DFA.txt xmin.txt
For testing simDFA.py I used DFA.txt and DFA01.txt and both worked 


To run textSearch.py enter python3 textSearch.py somestring.txt and it will output a description of a DFA that accepts a string if and only if it is a substring of x
